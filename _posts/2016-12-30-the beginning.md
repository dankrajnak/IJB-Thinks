In 2006, IJB Thinks was created as a space where JBers from around the world could share their feelings, experiences, and thoughts about anything they were passionate about.  Over the years, it's taken many forms, most notably as a semi-monthly magazine.  This year, for the first time, it's taken the form of a blog.  

#### What are the articles going to be about?
Anything!  While there may be certain themes we try to explore throughout the year, this will always be a space to express your thoughts about whatever you're passionate about.

#### So, who writes the articles?
Anyone! It doesn't matter how old you are, how long you've been involved in JB, who you know, or what CISV experiences you've had.  All that's necessary is a good idea and a passion to share it!

#### How do I write one?

Isn't this exciting?  Welcome to the new IJB Thinks.  Written using "Jekyll" and a theme created by HTML5 UP, made jekyll-compatible by Andrew Banchich, and modified slightly for the needs of this publication.
