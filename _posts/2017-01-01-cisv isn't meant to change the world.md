*"CISV isn’t meant to change the world."*

As I wrote it in my notebook, I couldn’t help but feel a little queasy—like I was standing on the edge of a ledge seeing how far I could lean over without getting nervous.  The conclusion of some routine stream of consciousness exercise had resulted in a menacing realization. Was I trying to rationalize something that should not be rationalized, something that if realized could shake my foundation in the purpose and value of CISV?  I couldn’t tell, so I leaned a little farther:  

When asked how CISV is changing the world, it’s difficult to come up with anything other than a rephrasing of our mission statement that mostly just dodges the question or some esoteric rhetoric that when stripped of its verbose and philosophic platitudes reveals ‘CISV is important for a well-functioning society’ or ‘We’re a children’s organization and we’re still growing, so once the kids grow up and we get larger we will have a visible impact’ or ‘I don’t really know, but it’s pretty cool, right?’  How is CISV changing the world now, really?  How is JB changing the world?  It’s a question not a lot of people can answer, but a question that desperately needs one.  What if it is a difficult question because the answer is “CISV is not focused on changing the world”?


Before you get mad at me, and before we fall off the ledge, I want to explain something.  There’s a reason we are so hesitant to say CISV is not changing the world, and it’s a beautiful reason.  It’s part of the reason why CISV can change the world.  It’s because to so many of us, CISV is not some summer camp that we go to once and a while to have fun, make a few friends, and find a significant other from another country.  CISV is and must be more.  It has helped in some way to make our lives at least a little more meaningful, a little more beautiful.  It is the way we feel we make a positive difference in the world.  It is, above any other involvement, something to be cherished because it is life-changing.  

CISV is life-changing.  That’s an important point.  It may not be world-changing, but it’s definitely life-changing.  You might be thinking, because CISV is life-changing it also has to be world-changing.  You might say the world we are trying to change is made up of lives, or we are inspiring people to be the change they want to see and therefore changing the world.  And you’re right.  We are changing the world, but in a comparatively minuscule way. There are dozens of organizations with budgets much smaller than ours that are creating a bigger and more visible impact in their communities. And that’s ok.

The mission of CISV is not to change the world, although we would definitely like to.  It is our vision, but not our mission.   Our mission, “to educate and inspire action for a more just and peaceful world,” is well paraphrased by “to prepare individuals to become active and contributing members of a peaceful society” and summarizes the mission of CISV well.  We have to accept that CISV is not built to change the world, it’s built to change people.  And if we try to force that mission on it we end up feeling hypocritical and unsuccessful.  We try to fry an egg with a toaster.

The swelling insecurity about whether CISV is really doing anything, the worries of hypocrisy entrenched in the way we do things results from a simple mission-drift.  The mission of our organization is not to create the change we talk about, it’s to change the lives of the people in our organization, to educate and inspire them to go out and create this change. This is an awesome mission, and one that shouldn’t make us feel somehow guilty or hypocritical.  CISV, at its core, is dialogue.  It’s a lesson.  It’s a foundation for meaningful citizenship.  

So what does this mean?  Well, most importantly, it means that CISV is not enough.  It means as an organization we can’t and shouldn’t try to change the world on our own.  It means we need to work with like-minded organizations both as an organization and as individuals.  It’s not enough to go to a CISV event and be content that we’ve created some change, that we’ve contributed something meaningful to the world.  It is just as important that we step outside of the comforting bubble of CISV and take action, that we be civically engaged in the betterment of our community and our world.  I know for most CISVers, who are often chronically busy, this is easier said than done.  While some of us are forced to wait till other commitments subside, we should at least realize the importance of volunteering with another, action-focused organization in the future.

In most of this article, which admittedly is getting a little long—thanks for reading this far—I’ve been writing about CISV.  Here’s where we get to the really interesting part.  Where does JB fit into all of this?  Is the purpose of JB to, like CISV,  just educate and inspire?  Is it to provide CISVers a way to impact and better their community? Is JB the place where we foster leadership skills to be better citizens in the future and continue CISV’s curriculum year-round? Or is it a way that we impact the world outside of our organization?  Honestly, we’re still trying to figure that out.  What do you think?  What should JB be focused on?  That’s one of the coolest things about JB.  You get to decide.

P.S. There’s this really cool thing called IPP or International People’s Project, which, unlike most other programmes, is focused on impacting and growing with a local community.  It’s service and action oriented, and it applies CISV principles as a strategy to solve problems and begin change.  The fact that it exists proves that this is a really cool time for CISV.  It serves as an exception to this article.
