In 2006, the Junior IJR, Marcos Tourinho, had an idea of revitalizing the IJB Infoletter.  He created two publications—JB Connect and IJB Thinks.  JB Connect was meant to be a JB-focused publication through which JBers could share their experiences in JB with others and everyone could learn from the best practices and the problem-solving of others.  IJB Thinks was different; it was a place where JBers could share ideas on anything.  Its scope was unlimited, and through the years of its publications articles have covered everything from a CISVer’s  experiences in protests in Egypt, to criticisms of our organizational structure.  It’s been in many forms over the years, from a collection of articles, to a series of videos, to a series of questions and answers coming from across the world.  And this year, still, it will be different.

So, why do we keep on changing it?  Why not just stick with what has worked before?  Well, because JBers like to snowboard.

(Strap on your seat belts, because this is about to be one of those Daniel Krajnak metaphor things.)

Generally, when you are on top of a mountain, you have two options to get down quickly (ok except for falling)—skiing or snowboarding.  Currently up in the mountains of Montana with my family, these were my choices.  Out of the five of us, I was the only one who chose to snowboard. Now, I don’t want to say that skiing is not challenging or that it does not take effort and time to learn, or that I am special in someway.   But I do think that snowboarding is much more difficult to learn.  And as the rest of my family makes their way up to the top of the mountain and breathe in the cloudy fog, and brilliant long-stretching views before (sometimes) gracefully zig-zagging their way down river-like flows of snow, I’m stuck at the bottom of the mountain on the bunny hills spending most of my time trying to get back up.  Because I’ve skied before, I could probably take two hours to get the hang of it again, and meet my family on the top of the mountain.  So why would I, or anyone with my experience level try to snowboard?  And why do I see so many snowboarders on the slopes?

In my case, at least, there’s a certain thrill in taking the more difficult path— to jump into something that’s harder, more dangerous (in this case literally more physically dangerous), to look down a hill and think, “yeah I definitely am going to fall if I go down that” and then going down anyway… and falling.  You have to be just a little crazy, a little foolish, and (maybe more that a little) stubborn. 

And my guess would be that, more often than not, JBers are the ones that would try to snowboard.  In this organization, we often learn leadership by getting on a chairlift, slowly sliding down a hill, then going a bit too fast, hitting the snow pretty hard, getting back up, brushing ourselves off, and trying to get down the rest of the hill without making the same mistake.  It’s experiential and thrilling and rewarding if not exhausting and sometimes bone-breaking.

**We try to do things we can’t because wouldn’t it be cool if we could?**  Because when we finally get to the top of the mountain on a frickin snowboard we’ll be able to look back and realize that version of ourselves falling down on the small hills would be proud.  And, for us, that’s all the view we need.

…ok, so why is IJB Thinks a blog?  And why do we constantly try to reinvent our organization?  And why aren’t we efficient as we could be?  Well, because JBers like to snowboard.

No, seriously why is JB Thinks a blog now?  And why does it look so amazing, I mean damn :).  Because:
* It will greatly reduce the amount of time before writing and publication, allowing IJB Thinks to become more responsive, diverse and, in a certain sense, alive.
* Articles could be categorized, and shared more easily.
* The impact and reach of IJB Thinks could be measured more easily, and therefore the blog can adapt to engage a broader audience. 

Will it be like this forever?  Well, maybe, maybe not.  Like I said, JBers like to snowboard.
