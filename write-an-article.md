So, you want to write an article?  **That's really cool.**  Feel free to submit one whenever!  Here's how you do that:

1. **Send an email to [{{site.email}}](mailto: {{site.email}}).**

Pretty easy, right?  In this email you should include your name, where you're from (optional), the title for your article, a very short (10 words or less) description, a large image to be paired with your article (**required**), and of course, your article.

As when IJB Thinks was first started, articles should be *"interesting, well thought(-out), and, if possible, surprising."*

Here's the cool part, if you would like, you can write your article using something called Markdown.  Markdown lets you format your article exactly like you want it to be.  For example, want to make your text **bold**?  Write it like `**this**`.
Want to make it *italicized*?  Write it like `*this*`.

* Want 
* to
* make
* a
* list?

``` 
* Write
* It
* Like
* This
```

`> "Like this."`

Our website can understand Markdown, and will format it automatically!<br>

### Frequently Asked Questions

<dl>
	<dt>Do I have to use Markdown?</dt>
	<dd> <p>No, it's not required. If you would like, you can include your article as a word document, or simply type it in your email.  However, the formattting may need to be changed.</p></dd>

	<dt>What if I want to include a table, or two collumns or something I'm not sure how to do?</dt>
	<dd><p>We want to make sure your article looks great.  Just ask, and we will try to accomodate any special needs you may have.</p> </dd>

	<dt>How long should my article be? </dt>
	<dd> <p>However long it takes to say what you want to say.  Check out some of the articles to get a feel for how long the average one is.  Keep in mind reading time.  Every 200 words takes about a minute to read.  It's standard to try to keep reading time below 7 minutes, but if you can't find a way to shorten your article or have a lot to say, this rule can be broken!</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Are all articles that are submitted published?</dt>
	<dd> <p>In short, no.  In some cases, we may ask you to revise what you've written.  The attention of our readers is incredibly valuable, and we want to make sure that what we publish reflects our commitment to them.  Not to worry, though, if your article isn't quite ready the first time you submit it, we'll do our best to give you suggestions for a second draft.    </p>
	</dd>

	<dt>What if my article doesn't get picked? </dt>
	<dd> <p>That's ok! The best thing to do is to revisit what you wrote and revise!  There's nothing wrong with trying again.  Ask yourself, "How do I make this more engaging?"  Pretend you only have a limited amount of the words and force yourself to squeeze all the juice from them.  Ask others to read your articles and take their advice. </p>
	</dd>

	<dt> I noticed a mistake in one of my articles, can I fix it?</dt>
	<dd><p>Absolutely.  Just send us an <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">email</a>, and we'll do our best to fix the error!</p></dd>
